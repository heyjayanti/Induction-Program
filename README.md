  On the first day, we visited the Gurudwara Sahib inside our college campus. Spending an hour there in peace and prayer brought a calming start to this new journey. The environment felt peaceful, and it gave us a moment to reflect, be thankful, and seek blessings for the path ahead. It was a beautiful way to begin the day.
- Refreshment for students
  After the visit to the Gurudwara Sahib, we had a refreshment break arranged by the college. It included tea, cold drinks, snacks, and water bottles for everyone. It felt good to sit, relax, and casually interact with new classmates. This short break added warmth to the welcome

Following the refreshments, we proceeded with the registration process. Each student was formally registered with the college, marking our official entry into the institution.
- Visit to Auditorium
  After completing the registration, we were guided to the college auditorium where the main event was to begin. Students from different branches were seated separately  CSE and IT branches were placed in different sections. The auditorium was well prepared, and there was a sense of anticipation as we waited for the induction program to officially start.

Finally, the Guest of Honour, Mr. Rakesh Kumar, Chief Engineer at the Municipal Corporation of Ludhiana, spoke with genuine humility. Though he mentioned he wasn’t a professional speaker, his interactive and relatable way of talking made the session feel personal and honest. It was a great example of real world experience being shared with future engineers.


  ## Visit to Classroom
After the induction speeches, we were guided to the IT department classrooms to get familiar with our academic space. I was taken to my section, IT-B, where we got a first glimpse of the environment we will be learning in for the next few years. It gave a strong sense of belonging and excitement  like finally stepping into our field officially. The classroom visit helped us connect more deeply with our chosen branch and marked the true start of our engineering journey.

  we were addressed by our IT mentors and department teachers. They introduced themselves, shared their fields of proficiency, and explained their roles in our academic journey. We were informed that this year we are part of the Applied Sciences Department, and from the next year onward, we would officially become students of the IT Department under their direct guidance.

The session also introduced us to our personal mentors, who will support and guide us throughout the four years. Important points were highlighted  especially the value of maintaining regular attendance, participating in college activities, and staying academically consistent.

There was also discussion about Python, Linux, and the significance of understanding both theory and practical tools early on. The session gave us a clear picture of what lies ahead and the support system we have in place to help us succeed.

#DAY 2
## Key points
- English proficiency Test
  (9:30 AM – 10:30 AM)

The day began with an English Proficiency Test conducted from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM. The test covered basic grammar from the 10th-grade level, including sections on **reading comprehension**, **grammar**, and **writing**.

I felt confident during the grammar section and was able to answer most of the questions with ease. The reading section tested our ability to understand and analyze short passages, while the writing section assessed our ability to express thoughts clearly. Overall, my performance in the English section went well and gave me a good start for the day.

- Maths Proficiency Test
  (10:30 AM – 11:30 AM)

Immediately after the English test, we had the Maths Proficiency Test from 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM. While the questions were based on basic concepts, I found some of them tricky due to forgetting a few key formulas.

Even though the test didn’t go as smoothly as I hoped, it served as a good reality check. It helped me realize the importance of keeping core concepts fresh and gave me a much needed revision of basic math topics. The paper style itself was quite thoughtful and covered a wide range of foundational topics.

- Break
  (12:00 PM – 12:30 PM)

After the tests, we had a short lunch break from 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM. I kept it light and simple — just had some cucumbers. During the break, I walked around the campus with a friend. The campus atmosphere felt refreshing and open, which helped clear my mind after the exams.

We even visited the stationery shop inside the campus where I bought a new notebook. It felt nice to explore a bit and get familiar with the place in a casual way.

- Auditorium Lecture and interactivity with seniors
  (12:30 PM – 4:00 PM)

After lunch, we gathered in the auditorium for a series of lectures and fun sessions that lasted until 4:00 PM. The program started with a **warm and cheerful performance by a senior**, who sang beautifully and lifted everyone's mood.

Next, we had an informative session by volunteers from **Buddy4Study**, who spoke about the importance of applying for scholarships. They shared useful details about opportunities available to students and encouraged all of us to be proactive about financial support.

We were also addressed on an important topic  **food and health**. The speaker emphasized how students often neglect their eating habits, especially during stressful times, and how this can affect both physical and mental well-being. It was a good reminder to take care of ourselves while managing studies.

Later, our **college seniors guided us on how to use GitHub** to submit reports and projects — a very helpful and practical session. Finally, the **HOD addressed us again**, explaining the basic rules of the college, expected conduct, and the importance of staying disciplined throughout the journey.

The day ended at 4:00 PM
