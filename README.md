It was a great example of real world experience being shared with future engineers.


  ## Visit to Classroom
After the induction speeches, we were guided to the IT department classrooms to get familiar with our academic space. I was taken to my section, IT-B, where we got a first glimpse of the environment we will be learning in for the next few years. It gave a strong sense of belonging and excitement  like finally stepping into our field officially. The classroom visit helped us connect more deeply with our chosen branch and marked the true start of our engineering journey.
  
  ## Addressed by IT mentors and teachers
  we were addressed by our IT mentors and department teachers. They introduced themselves, shared their fields of proficiency, and explained their roles in our academic journey. We were informed that this year we are part of the Applied Sciences Department, and from the next year onward, we would officially become students of the IT Department under their direct guidance.

The session also introduced us to our personal mentors, who will support and guide us throughout the four years. Important points were highlighted  especially the value of maintaining regular attendance, participating in college activities, and staying academically consistent.

There was also discussion about Python, Linux, and the significance of understanding both theory and practical tools early on. The session gave us a clear picture of what lies ahead and the support system we have in place to help us succeed.

#DAY 2
## Key points
- English proficiency Test
  (9:30 AM – 10:30 AM)

The day began with an English Proficiency Test conducted from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM. The test covered basic grammar from the 10th-grade level, including sections on **reading comprehension**, **grammar**, and **writing**.

I felt confident during the grammar section and was able to answer most of the questions with ease. The reading section tested our ability to understand and analyze short passages, while the writing section assessed our ability to express thoughts clearly. Overall, my performance in the English section went well and gave me a good start for the day.

- Maths Proficiency Test
  (10:30 AM – 11:30 AM)

Immediately after the English test, we had the Maths Proficiency Test from 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM. While the questions were based on basic concepts, I found some of them tricky due to forgetting a few key formulas.

Even though the test didn’t go as smoothly as I hoped, it served as a good reality check. It helped me realize the importance of keeping core concepts fresh and gave me a much needed revision of basic math topics. The paper style itself was quite thoughtful and covered a wide range of foundational topics.

- Break
  (12:00 PM – 12:30 PM)

After the tests, we had a short lunch break from 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM. I kept it light and simple — just had some cucumbers. During the break, I walked around the campus with a friend. The campus atmosphere felt refreshing and open, which helped clear my mind after the exams.

We even visited the stationery shop inside the campus where I bought a new notebook. It felt nice to explore a bit and get familiar with the place in a casual way.

- Auditorium Lecture and interactivity with seniors
  (12:30 PM – 4:00 PM)

After lunch, we gathered in the auditorium for a series of lectures and fun sessions that lasted until 4:00 PM. The program started with a **warm and cheerful performance by a senior**, who sang beautifully and lifted everyone's mood.

Next, we had an informative session by volunteers from **Buddy4Study**, who spoke about the importance of applying for scholarships. They shared useful details about opportunities available to students and encouraged all of us to be proactive about financial support.

We were also addressed on an important topic  **food and health**. The speaker emphasized how students often neglect their eating habits, especially during stressful times, and how this can affect both physical and mental well-being. It was a good reminder to take care of ourselves while managing studies.

Later, our **college seniors guided us on how to use GitHub** to submit reports and projects — a very helpful and practical session. Finally, the **HOD addressed us again**, explaining the basic rules of the college, expected conduct, and the importance of staying disciplined throughout the journey.

The day ended at 4:00 PM

It was highly informative and helped many of us feel more confident about making smart choices for our academic needs.

# Day 5

Today was the first time it truly felt like college. The day started with a really engaging interactive session with our seniors, focused on C++ programming. It wasn't just theory they walked us through the basics, explained core concepts like loops, variables, and logic building in a very relatable way. What made it more interesting was their friendly attitude; they shared not just programming tips but also their real struggles, mistakes, and how they overcame them. It felt less like a lecture, and more like a conversation with someone who’s just a few steps ahead.

The session made C++ feel less intimidating. Many of us asked questions, even the ones who are usually silent, and it created a nice flow of back-and-forth. Seniors also gave us some helpful advice on how to approach coding from day one  like practicing small problems daily, building logic slowly, and not running behind syntax perfection.

After that, our professors took over and we moved into learning BEEE (Basic Electrical and Electronics Engineering). It was our first formal exposure to this subject, and the professors made sure to introduce the foundational topics with clarity. They gave real-life examples to explain how electrical concepts connect to modern devices we use every day. The pace was a bit fast, but the explanations made it manageable.

Overall, today felt like a true bridge between school and college. The interaction with seniors gave motivation, and the classes made it clear – the real journey has begun. I'm slowly getting used to the rhythm of lectures, interactions, and self study. It’s a mix of excitement and pressure, but I’m learning to balance both.

## 4:00 PM | Day Wrap-Up
After a productive and energetic day, we packed up and headed home.

# Day 7

Today was quite an engaging day at college. We started off with C++ classes conducted by our seniors. They patiently walked us through the concepts, explaining them in a way that felt simple yet interesting. Most of it was a revision of the basics, but the way they shared examples and real-life applications made even the familiar topics feel fresh. I liked how approachable they were, and it felt less like a formal lecture and more like a friendly discussion.

After that, we moved on to our chemistry class with our regular teacher. Honestly, it turned out to be the highlight of the day. The topic we covered was taught in such a clear and lively manner that I found myself genuinely enjoying the subject. The explanations were detailed, and the way our teacher connected theory to practical examples kept everyone’s attention. I left the class feeling like I had actually learned something new and meaningful. Overall, it was a day that reminded me why I enjoy being here.

# Day 8

Our classes began at 9:00 AM today and the first session lasted until 10:30 AM. It was on BEEE (Basic Electrical and Electronics Engineering), and the lecture was genuinely engaging. Ma’am started by walking us through the syllabus, giving us a clear idea of what to expect in the coming weeks. We made neat and organized notes, which I think will be really helpful later. She also guided us through solving a few numerical problems related to force, work, joules, and other basic concepts. It was a good mix of theory and practice, and I felt more confident about the topic by the end of the class.

From 10:30 AM to 12:00 PM, we had an interactive session on coding with our sir. Instead of just teaching us syntax or code directly, he spoke about the bigger picture—how companies actually select students, what they look for beyond just technical knowledge, and the common flaws students make during preparation. He also gave us valuable advice on the mindset and skills we need to develop if we want to stand out. The session felt more like a mentor guiding us about life and career rather than just a class, which made it even more impactful.
